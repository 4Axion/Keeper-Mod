This is actually the template given by 4Axion.
It's basically the same as the one in the finished product except without the proper art, and the proper songs and stuff.
Dialogue is also temporary. If you want the finished version, you can either:
download the finished version, take the missing assets and put them over the temporary ones.
Or: download the mod itself lmao
Anyway: have fun I guess, please play the finished product before compiling this!
- GameWorld1 and the rest of the dev team

READ PLS - If you happen to use any of this credit 4Axion or I attempt to sue you. (jk(no jk(actually jk, please credit me lol ;-;)))
